{-| Cryptography
||| â€“ HMAC

    Currently it only works with hash functions
    that take hex-encoded strings.

    Most of these hashing functions in Elm take a `String` as argument,
    which they then convert to single-byte UTF-8 (or something like that).
    If we decode the output of the hashing function we won't get single-byte UTF-8,
    but another form of Unicode. WHICH IS PROBABLY THE REASON WE CAN'T PASS IT
    AGAIN TO THE HASHING FUNCTION.

    Disclaimer: The above may not be true at all, but that's what I assume.
